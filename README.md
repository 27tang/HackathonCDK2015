# BookBook

BookBook is a hackathon project made for the PSU + CDK Global 24-hour hackaton built by csnow, 27tang, and maxmarchuk. BookBook is a webapp made with AngularJS designed to help students at Portland State University exchange textbooks.

### Technology
BookBook uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [[AngularJS]](https://angularjs.org/) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [[Twitter Bootstrap]](http://getbootstrap.com/) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps

We plan on using the following technologies for the future implementation of BookBook
* [[node.js]](https://nodejs.org/) - evented I/O for the backend
* [[Express]](http://expressjs.com/) - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
