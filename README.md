# BookBook

BookBook is a hackathon project made for the PSU + CDK Global 24-hour hackaton built by [Chance Snow](https://github.com/chances), [27tang](https://github.com/27tang), and [Max Marchuk](https://github.com/maxmarchuk). BookBook is a webapp made with AngularJS designed to help students at Portland State University exchange textbooks.

### Technology
BookBook uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps

We plan on using the following technologies for the future implementation of BookBook
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
